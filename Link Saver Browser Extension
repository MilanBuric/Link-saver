Project Description:

Overview:
-This project is a Chrome extension designed to help users save, manage, and organize their favorite URLs efficiently.
-It allows users to input URLs manually, save the currently active tab, delete selected or all saved links, and even shorten URLs using the TinyURL API for cleaner sharing.

Objectives:
The main goal of this project was to create a simple yet functional tool for tracking and managing web links in a convenient browser extension interface. Key objectives included:
Allowing users to quickly save links manually or directly from the active browser tab.
Providing the ability to delete individual, selected, or all saved links.
Implementing URL shortening to make saved links more compact and shareable.
Persisting the saved links using Chrome’s storage.sync API so that links remain accessible across browser sessions.

Technologies Used:
JavaScript (ES6) – core logic for managing links, handling events, and interacting with APIs.
HTML & CSS – user interface design and layout for buttons, input fields, checkboxes, and the link list.
Chrome Extension APIs – specifically chrome.storage.sync for storing data, and chrome.tabs to access the currently active tab.
TinyURL API – for shortening URLs to create more manageable links.

How It Works:
Saving Links: Users can type a URL into an input field and click the "Save" button or press Enter. The URL is added to an array and saved in Chrome storage.
Saving Current Tab: Clicking the "Save Tab" button automatically grabs the URL of the currently active tab, shortens it using the TinyURL API, and stores it.
Rendering Links: The extension dynamically creates a list of all saved links, each with a clickable link and a checkbox for selection.

Deleting Links: Users can delete selected links via checkboxes or remove all links at once using the "Delete All" button. The storage is updated immediately after deletion.

Persistent Storage: All URLs are saved using chrome.storage.sync, ensuring that links persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Additional Features:
URL shortening improves readability and makes links easier to share.
Alerts provide immediate feedback to the user when a link is saved, deleted, or if an error occurs.
The interface supports keyboard interactions (e.g., pressing Enter to save a link).
